# Password-Generator

# Description

I created a password generator that takes in inputs from a user and displays a custom random password for the user to use. In this web app we use HTML, CSS, and Javascript. When a user selects the generate password button, they are asked how long of a password they would like it to be and what type of contents they would like in their password(uppercase letter, lowercase letters, numbers, or special characters). The program will then generate a password using the criteria provided and display it on the page.

This is what the program should look like :
